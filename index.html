<p>Boop is an an app developed for iOS users (8.0 and above) to detect levels of light and interpret this information with sound. It allows its blind and visually impaired users to detect whether lights are on or off. It covers a broad range of light levels which span from sensing daylight through open windows to checking whether the indicator light is on for a wifi router.</p>

<p>Boop does not require any additional hardware and has been tested on a variety of different phones (4s-6s) in addition to iPads. </p>

<h2>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<p>There are other light detectors on the app store, but we argue Boop is the best for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boop is free</li>
<li>Boop provides a larger range of light detection by using more than simple pixel values from the camera.  We also factor in the camera exposure and sensitivity levels, leading to a robust light detection that's insensitive to varying lighting conditions or high contrast and provides higher resolution than its competitors.</li>
<li>Boop is fast and responsive.  Our app consists of one single screen and uses an asynchronous system to simultaneous track light levels and send quick, audible feedback.</li>
<li>Boop was developed with the accessibility voice over features in mind.  We make use of the gestures and have the familiar magic touch (or two finger double tap) to exit the app.</li>
<li>Last, and possibly most importantly, we have a vibrate feature for using the app in quiet areas.  Based on the frequency of vibrations, you can estimate light intensity and source location.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="screen-overview" class="anchor" href="#screen-overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Screen Overview</h3>

<p>The following are 4 screenshots taken while using Boop. The app is structured as follows: display of video capture on top, reading of luminescence in the middle, and a toggle vibrate button at the bottom.  All items are centered in the screen and easy to access.  </p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/arii/boop/blob/master/screenshots/1.PNG?raw=true" alt="Screenshot 1 - low visibility ">
<img src="https://github.com/arii/boop/blob/master/screenshots/2.PNG?raw=true" alt="Screenshot 2 - medium low visibility ">
<img src="https://github.com/arii/boop/blob/master/screenshots/3.PNG?raw=true" alt="Screenshot 2 - medium high visibility ">
<img src="https://github.com/arii/boop/blob/master/screenshots/4.PNG?raw=true" alt="Screenshot 3 - high visibility "></p>

<p>This app can help you determine where a light source is located.  To help achieve this directional sensing, only the light level at the center of the video screen (directly perpendicular to the phone face) is measured.  In the 3rd and 4th screenshot, the ceiling lamp is within the capture view. However, the 4th screenshot has the lamp centered and has a much higher luminescence reading (which goes from 0 - 100) .</p>

<h3>
<a id="starting-the-app" class="anchor" href="#starting-the-app" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Starting the App</h3>

<p>Use the default iOS navigation to open Boop.  When Boop starts you will feel a sequence of 3 vibration pulses to let you know it is running. </p>

<p>The first time using the app, you will need to give it permission to access your camera. If you don't do this then the app will display an error at the bottom of the screen.  Manually go into your settings and enable Boop's access to your camera.</p>

<h3>
<a id="closing-the-app" class="anchor" href="#closing-the-app" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Closing the App</h3>

<p>The app shuts down whenever you exit out of it to preserve your phone's memory and battery life. To exit the app hit the home key.
<strong>Voice Over users:</strong> In addition to using the home key to shutdown the app, you can use the "magic tap" or two finger double tap to exit.</p>

<h3>
<a id="vibrate-on-or-off" class="anchor" href="#vibrate-on-or-off" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vibrate On or Off</h3>

<p>The main feature you can change in the app is vibrate on or off.  To do this, toggle the button at the bottom-center of the screen. 
<strong>Voice Over users:</strong> In addition to toggling the vibrate switch, you can use the "Two-finger scrub" as well on any part of the screen.  This is the Z-shaped gesture, also called an Escape, performed with two fingers.</p>

<h3>
<a id="volume-control" class="anchor" href="#volume-control" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Volume Control</h3>

<p>The volume can be controlled by the volume keys at the side of the phone .  You can make the overall volume higher or lower.  Additionally, the mute switch will shut off any sound coming from Boop.  This can be used with the vibration on to sense light levels in quiet areas such as a library or near a sleeping partner.</p>

<h3>
<a id="hearing-the-light-level-reading" class="anchor" href="#hearing-the-light-level-reading" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hearing the Light Level Reading</h3>

<p>Voice over users can simply tap the center of the screen where the luminescent reading is labeled.  Then, voice over will read to you the value of the light reading, which ranges from 0 - 100. </p>

<h2>
<a id="safety-and-privacy" class="anchor" href="#safety-and-privacy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Safety and Privacy</h2>

<p>Boop requests camera access to determine the mount of light in the center of the camera's image. It computes the luminescent score and does not save any images.</p>

<p>Boop does not have any questionable content- it only displays two types of messages:</p>

<ul>
<li>luminescent reading</li>
<li>error message since boop does not have access to the camera</li>
</ul>

<p>Boop does not store any metadata or other user generated content.  Boop does not have advertisements.</p>

<h2>
<a id="boop-is-free" class="anchor" href="#boop-is-free" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Boop is FREE</h2>

<p>Boop is free and will continue to be free.  If you would like to support us, leave a positive review for our application.  Additionally, we encourage donations to VIBUG.org and Perkins School for the blind.</p>

<p>Boop is developed by Ariel Anders and Daniel Preston. The first version of our app was created while participating in the MIT Assistive Technology Hackathon 2016 with teammate Areej Al-Wabil.</p>

<p>The idea for our app was presented by Jonathan Gale, a blind avid iPhone user.  Jonathan wanted to use his phone to determine if lights were on in his home to save energy.  Jonathan helped with all aspects of our development including rigorous testing during and after ATHack.  </p>

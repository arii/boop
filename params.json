  "body": "### Boop Light Detector App\r\nBoop is an an app developed for iOS users (8.0 and above) to detect levels of light and transmit this information with sound. It allows its blind and virtually impaired users to detect if lights are on or off. Its wide range of detection enables it to detect small differences of light, such as if the indicator light is on for a wifi router. \r\n\r\nBoop does not require any additional hardware and has been tested on a variety of different phones (4s-6s) in addition to iPads. \r\n\r\n![Jonathan testing out Boop at Athack 2016](http://assistivetech.mit.edu/athack/img/2016/app_testing.jpg)\r\n\r\n \r\n##Features\r\nThere are other light detectors on the app store, but we argue Boop is the best for the following reasons:\r\n* Boop is free\r\n* Boop has a larger range of light detection by using more than raw lumincense computation from pixels.  We also factor in the camera exposure and sensitivity leading to a robust light detection that's insensitive to varying lighting conditions and provides higher resolution than its competitors.\r\n* Boop is fast and responsive.  Our app consists of one single screen and uses an asynchronous system to simultaneous track light levels and send quick, audible feedback.\r\n* Boop was developed while testing the accessibility voice over features.  We make use of the gestures and have the familiar magic (or two finger double tap) to exit the app\r\n* Last, and possibly most importantly, we have a vibrate feature for using the app in quiet areas.  Based on the frequency of vibrations, you can estimate the light intensity.\r\n\r\n### How to use Boop\r\n\r\n## screen overview\r\nThe following are 4 screenshots taken while using loop. The app is structured as follows: display of video capture on top, reading of luminescence in the middle, and a toggle vibrate button on the bottom.  All items are centered in the screen and easy to access.  \r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 1 - low visibility ](https://github.com/arii/boop/blob/master/screenshots/1.PNG?raw=true)\r\n![Screenshot 2 - medium low visibility ](https://github.com/arii/boop/blob/master/screenshots/2.PNG?raw=true)\r\n![Screenshot 2 - medium high visibility ](https://github.com/arii/boop/blob/master/screenshots/3.PNG?raw=true)\r\n![Screenshot 3 - high visibility ](https://github.com/arii/boop/blob/master/screenshots/4.PNG?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis app is supposed to tell you where the light is.  Therefore, the camera needs to be lined up with the light.  In the 3rd and 4th screenshot, the ceiling lamp is within the capture view. However, the 4th screenshot has the lamp centered and has a much higher luminescence reading (which goes from 0 - 100) .\r\n\r\n# starting the app\r\nUse the default iOS navigation to open Boop.  When Boop starts you will feel a sequence of 3 vibration pulses to let you know it's now running. \r\n\r\nThe first time using the app, you will need to give it permission to access your camera. If you don't do this then the app will display an error at the bottom of the screen.  Manually go into your settings and enable Boop's access to your camera.\r\n\r\n# closing the app\r\nThe app shutdowns whenever you exit out of it to preserve your phone's memory and battery life. To exit the app hit the home key.\r\n**Voice Over users:** In addition to using the home key to shutdown the app, you can use the \"magic tap\" or two finger double tap to exit.\r\n\r\n# vibrate on or off\r\nThere is only one feature you can change with the app: vibrate on or of.  To do this, toggle the button at the bottom-center of the screen. \r\n**Voice Over users:** In addition to toggling the vibrate switch, you can use the \"Two-finger scrub\" as well on any part of the screen.  This is the Z-shaped gesture, also called an Escape, performed with two fingers.\r\n\r\n# volume control\r\nThe volume can be controlled by the volume keys at the side of the phone .  You can make the overall volume higher or lower.  Additionally, the mute switch will shut off any sound coming from Boop.\r\n\r\n# hearing the luminescent reading\r\nVoice over users can simply tap the center of the screen where the luminescent reading is labeled.  Then, voice over will read to you the value of the light reading, which ranges from 0 - 100. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Boop is FREE\r\nBoop is free and will continue to be free.

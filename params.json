  "body": "### Boop Light Detector App\r\nBoop is an an app developed for iOS users (8.0 and above) to detect levels of light and transmit this information with sound. It allows its blind and virtually impaired users to detect if lights are on or off. Its wide range of detection enables it to detect small differences of light, such as if the indicator light is on for a wifi router. \r\n\r\nBoop does not require any additional hardware and has been tested on a variety of different phones (4s-6s) in addition to iPads. \r\n\r\n![Jonathan testing out Boop at Athack 2016](http://assistivetech.mit.edu/athack/img/2016/app_testing.jpg)\r\n\r\n \r\n##Features\r\nThere are other light detectors on the app store, but we argue Boop is the best for the following reasons:\r\n* Boop is free\r\n* Boop has a larger range of light detection by using more than raw lumincense computation from pixels.  We also factor in the camera exposure and sensitivity leading to a robust light detection that's insensitive to varying lighting conditions and provides higher resolution than its competitors.\r\n* Boop is fast and responsive.  Our app consists of one single screen and uses an asynchronous system to simultaneous track light levels and send quick, audible feedback.\r\n* Boop was developed while testing the accessibility voice over features.  We make use of the gestures and have the familiar magic (or two finger double tap) to exit the app\r\n* Last, and possibly most importantly, we have a vibrate feature for using the app in quiet areas.  Based on the frequency of vibrations, you can estimate the light intensity.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Boop is FREE\r\nBoop is free and will continue to be free.  If you would like to support us, leave a positive review for our application.  Additionally, we encourage donations to VIBUG.org and Perkins School for the blind.\r\n\r\n### News\r\n* The MIT assistive technology hackathon was in the news: http://www.ll.mit.edu/news/students-build-assistive-technologies-for-Boston-residents-in-need.html\r\n\r\n* We received honorable mention at athack: http://assistivetech.mit.edu/athack/2016.html\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nBoop is developed by Ariel Anders and Daniel Preston while participating in the MIT Assistive Technology Hackathon 2016.  \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to shoot us a message at aanders@mit.edu",
